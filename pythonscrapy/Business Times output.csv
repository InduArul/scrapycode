"[NEW YORK] While global banks have been pouring money into information technology - to the tune of US$1 trillion over three years - only a handful appear to be fully committed to a digital transformation and are therefore reaping the benefits, according to an Accenture Plc study.,Just 19 banks among the 161 largest retail and commercial banks that the consulting firm examined have been focusing enough on digital strategies to ""make the shift to a different sort of bank,"" Accenture said in the report, released on Thursday. And those that did were rewarded for their efforts, the firm said.,All the banks studied, based in 21 countries, started at roughly similar rates of return on equity in 2011, but by 2017 the banks that Accenture identified as ""digital focused"" had ROE that rose 0.9 percentage points. The 81 least digitally focused banks, meanwhile, saw their ROE slip 1.1 percentage points - and Accenture researchers said the gap is likely to continue to widen through 2021. ROE at a middle group of 61 ""digital active"" banks was little changed.,""You could see in those three groups the performance deferential,"" Alan McIntyre, an Accenture senior managing director and co-author of the report, said in an interview. ""You see a gap, and where the gap is coming from, and it's coming from digital."",The US$1 trillion estimate by Accenture is for retail and commercial banks globally, and includes all internal and external hardware, software, service and information-technology staff costs. The most digitally focused banks became more profitable through cost-cutting, Accenture researchers said, and Wall Street has rewarded them with higher valuations. While the study didn't include names of the banks studied, Mr McIntyre said that the 19 most digitally focused banks include JPMorgan Chase & Co.,New York-based JPMorgan, the largest US bank, has been a top spender among financial firms in the technology arms race. In February, it said it planned to boost its tech budget by US$600 million to US$11.4 billion this year.,BLOOMBERG,SPH Digital News,© 2019 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD.

"Singapore,SMALL and medium businesses (SMB) in Singapore are the most digitally mature in the Asia-Pacific region, ahead of peers in countries such as Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, according to a new index by Cisco.,This is based on an assessment of firms' digital maturity in four areas: technology adoption and application; digital transformation strategy and organisation; processes and governance; and talent.,The APAC SMB Digital Maturity Index was developed by research firm IDC based on a survey with 1,340 respondents from 14 economies. It found that more than 60 per cent of SMBs in Asia-Pacific have started to embrace digitalisation.,Singapore's firms were classified as being in the ""digital observer"" stage, the second out of four stages.,Cisco described this stage as one where ""digital efforts have started but remain tactical""; initiatives are bite-sized; firms are focused on automation; technology investments are siloed; strategies are not well-coordinated; and some cloud resources are used.,The top digital technology that firms in Singapore are investing in is cybersecurity, cited by 16.7 per cent of respondents. Second was cloud technology, named by 12.9 per cent, followed by analytics at 11.2 per cent.,As for obstacles to digital transformation, the two most common hurdles were a lack of digital skills and talent, and a lack of insight into operational and customer data, each cited by 16.7 per cent of respondents.,Coming third at 13.1 per cent was a ""lack of perceived value for digital transformation"" in respondents' own industries.,""To get ahead, SMBs need to be more savvy with government initiatives that have been set up to support them,"" said Cisco Singapore managing director Tay Bee Kheng. Cisco is developing a pipeline of digital talent for the industry via its Cisco Networking Academy, he added.,The survey found that 41.4 per cent of respondents in Singapore are aware of government initiatives that support SMB digitalisation and have benefited from them. Another 52.9 per cent are aware but have not taken part in these programmes.,Bidhan Roy, Cisco's Asean regional director and general manager of SMB markets and distribution, said: ""The exceptional enabling environment in Singapore for innovation and digital transformation, combined with modern, upgradeable infrastructure, means that SMBs can readily take advantage of new innovations as they become available."",The report's recommendations for small firms in Singapore include: having a clear digital transformation strategy and roadmap; finding digital champions in the organisation; and finding technology partners.,SPH Digital News,© 2019 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD.

"[MADRID] It took Maite Alvarez, a Stanford University-trained immunologist, seven years to plot her return to Spain.,""Coming home has been a very positive experience,"" said Alvarez, 36, who returned in March to take up a post at the University of Navarra's cancer immunology lab in Pamplona. ""The idea was always to come back to Spain to be close to family and continue my research."",Twenty straight quarters of expansion is giving talented young Spaniards a reason to return home, picking up the thread of disrupted professional lives enriched by the skills and experience gathered abroad. Statistics show Spain is reaching an inflection point: it's on the cusp of becoming a net immigration nation once again after a decade in which the country's economic crash meant tens of thousands left in search of better job opportunities.,That said, for many returnees the homecoming can be rough as wages are capped by Spain's high unemployment -- the jobless rate, although down from a peak in 2013 of 26.9 per cent, is at 14.5 per cent, with joblessness for the youth at 38.6 per cent. The low-pay work has given rise to gallows humor with a Twitter feed called Mierda Jobs that lists ""shitty"" jobs.,Still, the recovery is allowing companies like Banco Santander SA to begin hiring again. The euro area's largest bank is attracting talent -- especially in digital -- to its operations in its home country, Chairman Ana Botin said.,‘Best and Brightest',Santander ""is creating new opportunities for the best and brightest new talent, while also making it possible for those who left in the past to come home,"" Botin said in an email. ""In the past, top data scientists and artificial intelligence experts had to leave Spain to find leading-edge projects."",Botin listed a handful of names the bank has poached to beef up research in artificial intelligence and cyber security from companies such as Vodafone Group PLC, BlackRock Inc., and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Among them is Sara Perez, 31, who spent six years in London honing her skills as an information security analyst. She was lured back to Spain to take up the post of head of information security at Openbank, Santander's online lender, in Madrid.,Cyber-security awareness has ""created new opportunities for people in my profession to pursue more specialist career paths here in Spain that would have been much harder to come by five years ago,"" Perez said, adding that she was happy she got to work for a while in London, garnering new skills and experience.,About 190,000 Spaniards left Spain between the start of the crisis and end-2017. Working-age returnees will ease the pressure on a social security system hurt by the ageing workforce shrinking 0.3 per cent a year, said Maeva Cousin, an economist at Bloomberg Intelligence.,Fixing Bottlenecks,""Spanish citizens who had settled abroad during the crisis are starting to return, and net inflows of foreign citizens are increasing,"" Cousin said. ""With unemployment now close to its structural rate, this boost to Spanish labor force will reduce the risk of bottlenecks in the labor market and will help maintain strong growth for longer."",Anna Herranz, director of career services at IE University, says that for the past 18 months she's been receiving inquiries from alumni abroad looking for opportunities to return home. Unlike in the pre-crisis days, when finance reigned, the demand now is for technology, especially in data analysis and digital transformation, she said, adding a note of caution.,""Unemployment is still high,"" she said. ""If you come back, don't expect to find work in a month."",Like many European economies, Spain suffers from a mismatch of skills and jobs. In 2015, 22 per cent of workers in Spain were overqualified for their jobs, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development says. Many Spaniards are also forced to take jobs unrelated to their training or studies.,Gallows Humor,""This share of overlap is one of the highest among countries surveyed, and suggests costs to individuals and society in lost human capital investment,"" the OECD report concluded.,Alejandra de la Fuente, 24, a journalist, set up Mierda Jobs to detail what she considers abusive employment terms.,Recent jobs listed include a post for a driver in Madrid earning a base salary of up to 850 euros (S$1,325) a month for an 11-hour day. A Mexican restaurant in the capital is seeking waiters for shift work, offering from 1 euro to 1.60 an hour. ""If you like good tacos, this is the place for you,"" according to the advert.,""You can't live in Madrid with dignity on these types of wages,"" de la Fuente said.,Still, homesick citizens are returning.,Marc Chaler, 25, who left Spain for the UK in 2015 to study English and seek work, is back. After working in a restaurant and taking a catering job in an Oxford University college, he returned in the summer and landed a programming job in Valencia earlier this month.,""I missed my friends and family and my plan was always to pursue my career in Spain,"" Chaler said. ""I'm just beginning my career and I'm not asking for a big salary -- what I want is an opportunity to get off to a good start."",BLOOMBERG,SPH Digital News,© 2019 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD.
