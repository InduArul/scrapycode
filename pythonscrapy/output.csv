                                Speaking at a gala dinner celebrating the 20th anniversary of the news provider, Mr Lee said that the transformation of CNA is not a moment too soon.,SINGAPORE: The media landscape has become a far more cacophonous space, but it is precisely in this new environment that trusted news sources like CNA are more important than ever, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Friday (Mar 29).,Speaking at a gala dinner celebrating the ,, Mr Lee noted the transformation it has been making over the years as media consumption patterns change.,“Twenty years ago, people would read the newspaper in the morning for news from the preceding day and watch the evening news broadcast on TV for an update on the day’s events,” he said. “Today, however, with social media and the Internet, we consume news in real time, across multiple channels and platforms.”,“Traditional news broadcasters have no choice but to adapt, and to adapt quickly,” he said, adding that CNA’s transformation comes ""not a moment too soon"".,Mr Lee noted that from a single channel, CNA has become a multi-platform digital news source, including television, online and radio. ,“You have experimented with video, podcasts, interactive graphics and augmented reality, and even used drones to capture live footage, to engage viewers and enhance your storytelling,” he said.,He also described how CNA has branched out to produce original content, including current affairs programmes like The New Silk Road and Wild City, which have won international awards.,“CNA today is one voice amongst many. It is much harder for you to hold your audience’s attention. You have to fight to get your voice through.,“At the same time, your audience has a harder task to filter out the noise, and sieve out facts from the ocean of hearsay, propaganda and fake news,” he added.,Amid these developments in the media landscape, he stressed that CNA’s role has become more important than ever.,“Viewers, readers and listeners need to know where they can get reliable and factual news. They know that you have researched and verified your stories, and organised and presented them as objectively as possible,” he said.,“They look to your brand and track record, and trust you to help them make sense of how and why things are happening, so that they can form a coherent and accurate view of the world, and make their own well-informed judgments and decisions,"" he added.,Minister for Communications and Information S Iswaran echoed Mr Lee's sentiments. ,Having 13 bureaus across Asia has allowed CNA to bring to viewers a distinctive Asian perspective on issues that matter to the region and also on global matters.,""It's important that a broadcaster has a distinct value proposition and a distinctive voice. And I think that's what Channel NewsAsia has achieved over the last 20 years,"" he said. ,Noting that CNA has responded to technological changes well, with its online product and 24/7 news streaming, Mr Iswaran said adaptations such as these allow a broadcaster to remain relevant and competitive. ,""After all the technological change, the behavioural and consumption habit changes, I think the most important thing is that one has to remain a trusted source of news and with a reputation for quality journalism,"" he said. ,It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.,Copyright© Mediacorp 2019.

"Mumbrella Asia Awards,Mumbrella360 Asia,Mumbrella360 Asia,While television was the dominant home of brand building in the past, the game has changed and ecommerce platforms might just be the next powerhouse for start-ups looking to grow their companies and shift product, writes Mumbrella's Dean Carroll in a piece first published in his 'Best of the Month' newsletter,So the issue that has been nagging at me of late is what brand building will look like in the coming years.,It’s something I’ve been thinking about for a while. We’re are even running a session on the topic at the , in Singapore on May 7, so please do get your tickets and come along.,But why is the issue on my mind so much? Partly because the media and marketing scene now is so different from my pre-internet – before-the-advent-of-mobile-,phones – youth in Brexitland, formerly known as the United Kingdom.,Back then, we all gathered around the magic box in the corner of the room to watch (not very good) content punctuated by some (great) advertising. As a boy, I distinctly remember family and friends frequently uttering the phrase “oh, I like this one” whenever a great television commercial for Levi’s, or some other such zeitgeist brand, came on.,It might not have been a sophisticated model, when compared to today’s digital labyrinth of complexity, but it worked. And it allowed the likes of Dave Trott, Barbara Nokes, Lee Clow, Dan Wieden, Mary Wear, Diane Croll and Sir John Hegarty to emerge as creative forces able to entertain audiences while selling them product.,But those listed above are pretty much now in the adland hall of fame as legends of yore. And that all-commanding TV mass eyeballs model is all but finished. Take a look at the subject matter that people choose to wax lyrical on when writing our , feature.,Most choices are from the 1980s or 1990s, even those written by millennials (I hate the word too, but shorthand exists for the sake of brevity). That tells its own story.,Indeed, the growing apathy towards TVCs was once again brought home to me this week when our Asia editor Ravi Balakrishnan reported on , and moving from the ‘gross rating points’ metric to the ‘cost per mille’ measurement.,The reason? Because digital natives and “new economy advertisers” understand CPM very well, but have no concept of (or interest in) GRP. Playing devil’s advocate, a bigger question springs to mind. Do they have any concept of (or interest in) linear TV itself?,Another. Nail. In. The. Coffin. Sadly, those were the alarming keywords that immediately sprang to mind following the Mediacorp revelation. Especially when it was closely followed by the announcement that Channel News Asia is rebranding as ‘CNA’.,The reason being because CNA no longer wants to be associated with the television-centric word ‘channel’. Too analogue. Not digital enough for a “transmedia company”, apparently. Let’s be kind and call it pragmatism shall we.,Elsewhere this month though, there were more words of warning about outdated media activations. , and how it was a mistake to focus on TV-centred ads when “everybody is doing everything on their mobile phones”., ,This got me thinking about my own broadcast media habits. I’m only really subscribed to a bundle from a telco (more on that later) so that I can watch a sample of different news channels, in order to get a rounded view on current affairs. An annoying habit I developed years ago as a journo and one that I know by my wife’s face she thinks is weird, but is too kind to tell me so.,Of course there are still event TV shows on the networks like Asia’s Got Talent and Asia’s Next Top Model that draw a sizeable audience, and the significant advertising revenue to go with it. But to be frank, a good number of network channels and the productions they broadcast are uncared-for and under-resourced.,More often than not, in our house we stick to streaming platforms like Netflix where a degree of care, and budgetary investment, can be assumed. We are not alone, just take a look at how people consume in Mumbrella’s ,. Netflix is name-checked everywhere and TV networks nowhere.,One top ad agency CEO even told me recently he didn’t give a toss about TV, as his ads were “playing at the cinema down the road right now”. Fair enough, although cinema ads could do with a bit of quality and quantity control too though, it’s fair to say.,But is all this doom and gloom warranted? Perhaps my optic should shift. For certain ad campaigns still connect and gain traction. Even if it’s through column inches and social network debates rather than TV alone. For instance, , tour de force this month was a prize example of that phenomena.,And while respected , will tell you that Volkswagen only survived the emissions scandal due to its brand equity built up from half a century of great TV ads, and that when you walk down the supermarket aisles you will not see one brand built by digital advertising or surveillance targeting of consumers. Well, that may well be missing the point somewhat.,Don’t get me wrong, great ads can certainly still achieve great things. I love to watch them. And TV definitely still has a role to play. But ads usually go viral now because of a number of mediums. They include (organic and paid) social media and influencer campaigns (remember Fyre?) for example, rather than just because of the flickering box in the corner of the room., ,There has been a separation of power. Alternative mass-market arenas for brand building have indeed emerged elsewhere. I’m not just talking about the Facebook and Google ‘duopoly’ (I know, I’m fatigued by the word too but what can you do eh?) here.,In the United States and Europe, Amazon of course dominates retail and ecommerce. This segment is perhaps the new breeding ground for brands fuelled by user reviews, deep-dive product information and then some.,In South East Asia too, we have our very own such behemoth in the form of Alibaba-owned online shopping player Lazada. It delivers our weekly groceries. It’s where we bought our TV. It’s my go-to resource when doing any sort of online shopping. And I’m not even the target audience (‘millennials’ again, sorry to the wordsmiths out there).,With that in mind, I went along to ,a week or so ago. It was quite something. There were 300 of the platform’s top sellers (brands). The sort of start-ups you might see appearing on Shark Tank (full disclosure, I watched it on Netflix not on a TV network) after they’ve had a successful Kickstarter round to pump-prime their business., ,On top of that, for the event – which would have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to host and was a statement of intent to the market – more than 120 journalists were flown in from China, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. All presentations were simultaneously translated from English into Mandarin, Bahasa, Thai, Filipino and Vietnamese. That ain’t cheap to do.,During the conference, Lazada also launched its inaugural Brands Future Forum Awards. The gongs were designed to celebrate those brands doing interesting things on the platform. The winners were:,The firm claimed at the summit that it would dominate the future and it would do so via ‘shoppertainment’ – making shopping fun by way of blending it with entertainment. Explaining the concept, Lazada Group CEO Pierre Poignant mapped out how the newly-introduced livestreaming by sellers on the platform meant that customers could actually “engage with brands”.,Sounds like absolute piffle, right? And why would established brands put their bricks and mortar retail offering at risk by colluding with the third-party deathstar of online shopping?,Not necessarily, in the main we are talking about entrepreneurial smaller and medium-sized enterprises here (possibly the big brands of tomorrow). Although, that said, a lot of the big brands are there too. Except for the luxury retailers that is, who are still holding their noses.,The company has also integrated gamification, influencers and , into its app. These tools are already embraced wildly by consumers in China and are coming here next. Think Singles Day – now the biggest online shopping event in the world – on steroids.,Lazada claims all of this will help it, and the new brands being built on its platform, to harvest rich customer data that is indicative of buyer behaviour and trends.,For we know that parent company Alibaba’s gross merchandise value of products sold through its platforms is in excess of $485 billion. More than Amazon. More than Walmart. It is, without a doubt, the world’s largest retailer.,Lazada, therefore, does indeed have the critical mass behind it to rule South East Asia (it says it has no global ambitions due to competition in other markets from Amazon and its own parent company). It could still be losing hundreds of millions a year, as it was before the Alibaba acquisition in 2016. However, if so, that’s at least partly due to it building its own supply chain and investing for growth in tangible assets like warehouses, planes, ships and so on.,Here I want to reference for a minute marketing ,.,Lazada and its parent company Alibaba have the capital, the products, the regional reach, a degree of likability, vertical integration (even the idea of buying finance products on the app has been floated), the technology, the accelerant of top talent on their exec team and the geographical advantage; with Lazada’s Singapore headquarters being in SE Asia’s true business hub and Alibaba dominating in China’s mind-bogglingly massive market.,Indeed, Lazada Group president Jing Yin told me: “We want to be the incubator for new brands in South East Asia. It’s about giving the opportunity to the young dreamers.” In short, the ambition is to be the dominant home of brand building, just as TV once was back in the golden age of television.,So just maybe big tech platforms will be where the brand building of tomorrow gets done. Assuming that ,status and then break up the alleged monopolies in America, as she has promised to do. A trend that would no doubt make its way to the shores of Asia over time.,The good news is that brand building has a future. It simply looks nothing like the past. So I guess all of us in media and marketing land should be thankful for small mercies and try our best to adapt to the new normal.,And before I go, I did promise to tell you about my telco experience. So here goes.,Around a month ago, we moved out from the city to Singapore’s suburbs. As a result, we signed up for a new telco contract. A set-top box was tardily delivered and we settled down to enjoy some Netflix and myriad news channels (as I said, I know it’s weird).,Just two weeks later, said set-top box overheated and stopped working. A new one was eventually delivered – the telco first asking if we could take it back to the store ourselves and pick up the replacement. As you can imagine, “no thanks” was the polite answer.,When the engineer finally came out to our home to do a diagnosis, he explained that the new (smaller than before) set-top box had been badly designed. There was no longer the proper amount of ventilation incorporated into the design. Therefore, the replacement was likely to overheat again.,“My suggestion is to buy a fan and direct it at the box whenever you are using it,” he helpfully told us. “No thanks” was once again the polite reply from our side. True to his word, the replacement set-top box also overheated within three weeks and developed the same fault as the one before.,No problem. Let’s call the customer service line we thought. On doing so, we were told by the robot on the other end that the waiting time to speak to the human customer service agent was up to 30 minutes. No matter we thought, let’s fill in the online form to get this sorted. It was a fairly easy process and we immediately got a response: “We have received your email and will get back to you within three working days.”, ,What responsiveness. What agility. What customer care. That’s exactly what we didn’t think. Why am I telling you this? Well, the reason is that said telco is now at minus five on the brand index in my view. The whole experience was the opposite of brand building. It was, in effect, brand demolition.,And I suspect I’m not alone in having this experience with said telco in Singapore. You can probably guess the brand, but buy me a coffee and I’ll tell you which one it was.,You probably won’t be surprised to learn that the same telco runs the most lavish TVCs around. Admittedly, some of them are pretty damn good thanks to the client choosing a great creative agency. Coffee won’t be enough this time mind, you’ll have to fork out for lunch to get the agency out of me.,Anyway, I digress. Back to the matter at hand.,What is my message to the telco brand in question? Learn from history before it’s too late. Complacency kills. You may have decades of solid business under your belt, but the Netflix and Lazadas of this world are hungry. So beware. They are coming for your breakfast, lunch and dinner., ,Dean is the general manager at Mumbrella Asia. He is an experienced British journalist, who has worked in a number of international markets including Singapore, Australia, Dubai, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. As well as his media work, he is also a published academic.,I think Mark Ritson best summed up the issue with this sort of narrative with his lament about the ‘pornography of change’.,Talking about ‘nails and coffins’ might make for provocative copy, but it doesn’t really stack up if you analyse some of the key assertions this article makes:,1. “That all-commanding TV mass eyeballs model is all but finished”. If that is the case, then why are Google, Facebook and Amazon ploughing money into TV advertising (just check out the Amazon Super Bowl ads)? And why retailers around the world trying to replicate the John Lewis Christmas TV ad every year?,2. “Just take a look at how people consume in Mumbrella’s ‘My media habits’ series”. Why? Marketing professionals are not representative of the broader population. We might only watch Netflix on our iPhones but in many countries (eg US, UK) the proportion of people who view video ads through broadcast TV is about 70%.,3. “In the United States and Europe, Amazon of course dominates retail and commerce” – it doesn’t, not really. In the US, Amazon has 4% of all retail sales. That’s less than half of Walmart.,4. “The Netflix and Lazadas of this world are hungry. So beware. They are coming for your breakfast, lunch and dinner”. Not quite. Yes, they are growing quickly. But a reality check is needed. For example, “Even Netflix’s own data show that its members derive only 8% of their total video from their platform” (Professor Ritson again).,There are some interesting thoughts in this article, but a more balanced perspective on the reality of how brands need to evolve their marcomms mix would be welcome.,The world isn’t black and white. It’s a lovely shade of grey 😉,Good points,I would say though that it feels this article’s arguments are skewed by the author living in Singapore, where there is no question that linear TV is dead. Has been for many years, which is why other media options are popular. Hardly representative of a broader trend though.,

"Mumbrella Asia Awards,Mumbrella360 Asia,Mumbrella360 Asia,Singapore giant Mediacorp has torn up its traditional rate card for television, in order to appeal to a new generation of digital native advertisers more used to terms like CPM rather than the old world GRP metric.,It means discounts of up to 80% have been put in place across time slots.,First announced in February this year, Mediacorp claimed the card would offer “greater value, effectiveness and impact with advertising spend” and added “the restructured rate card has been optimised for parity with digital media, resulting in potential savings of up to 80%”.,This was done by introducing a  pricing structure based on the digital CPM model (the cost required to get 1,000 impressions or views of an ad), a shift from the traditional TV-metric of GRPs (gross rating points, arrived at by calculating the percentage of the target market reached by an ad, multiplied by the frequency of their exposure to the ad).,Mediacorp said this would create “a consistent buying language and method, completely aligned to how marketers are thinking and buying media”.,The second key element in the announcement was bringing greater flexibility to its master contracts. Clients who previously had their advertising spends tied to specific media, would now be able to deploy their budget across Mediacorp assets in TV, radio, digital and Out-Of-Home.,To get a deeper insight into just how these benefits would accrue to advertisers, Mumbrella spoke to Mediacorp’s chief commercial and digital officer Parminder Singh.,As per Singh, the starting point for the new rate card was to make television measurable, accountable and flexible.,Getting into greater detail on making television measurable, Singh said: “TV and digital video evolved in different time periods and trajectories and the terminology is very different.,“In a way, CPM and GRP are related. It is all about the effectiveness of ads but so far it has not been directly correlated or compared.”,Singh: Converting GRPs to CPM makes it easier for advertisers to decide the split between digital and television,Mediacorp intended to help advertisers who were used to doing GRP-based buys to get an idea of what that figure would mean in terms of CPM.,Explaining how the process works, Singh said: “Our customer group that works on a programme schedule comes up with projected ratings for different programmes. Depending on the time slot, the kind of programme and genre, the ratings change.,“We have a robust mechanism to project ratings for a programme in the future. We take the ratings, convert that to the expected number of people who would watch a particular programme and that gives us the number of impressions an ad is likely to deliver.,“Based on the number of impressions, we back calculate that into CPM and arrive at the projected CPM for that particular ad.,“It’s a robust system: our customer group gives us ratings, we convert that into impressions and then give the CPM for different ad slots.”,Asked specifically about the savings that are likely to accrue from this system — Mediacorp claimed it could be as high as 80% —Singh said: “Let us take one of our popular channels: Channel 5, for instance. A typical prime time slot in used to cost $4,000 before we put the new rate card in place.,“Now that we have adjusted it and changed the rate card and made it more proportional to the ratings, it could be as low as $800.,“That’s a pretty significant price change. It is more reflective of the audience impression and ratings. The change won’t be the same across slots. But in some of the slots the change is pretty drastic.”,Mediacorp expected the new rates to attract a fresh crop of advertisers. Singh said: “When advertisers know a medium is giving them better ROI and that it is measurable, accountable and flexible, they tend to increase investment.,“Some of the new economy advertisers may have believed TV is something they don’t understand since they are more versed in a CPM language. Or they may have felt a national screen is out of reach. They will now find it affordable. Our message is ‘go big on the national screen.’ We have all the storytelling ability of a big medium like television with all the flexibility and measurability of digital.”,Asked whether Mediacorp would be be able to meet its objective of attracting a wider base of advertisers, Omnicom Media Group Singapore and Malaysia CEO Ranga Somanthan said: “At this stage, we will probably see Mediacorp garner quick wins from mainly small- to medium-sized clients.,“What we are more excited about is the growth potential Mediacorp is creating, as it evolves to a more dynamic biddable pricing system in the next couple of years.”,This was in part a proactive move and in part, a reaction to what agencies and marketers expected. Singh said: “When we decided to use CPM, it was a clear input from our agency partners. They were already converting GRPs to effective CPMs.,“They said it would be great if the broadcaster helps them with that, officially. There is a great demand for CPM as a measure from advertisers.,“We have an inventory of prime and non-prime. In the world of online, it is reservation versus programmatic.,“The industry told us reservation can be equated to primetime and non-prime to programmatic. We can now tell advertisers, if you want to buy a primetime 9 pm drama on one of our popular channels, this is the CPM it will cost you. Compare that to digital video and decide where you’d like to put your money.”,Reacting to Mediacorp’s decision to offer a GRP to CPM conversion, Somanathan said: “Deploying CPM measurement as a benchmark allows Mediacorp to price themselves more competitively against demand and supply pressures coming from digital video inventory.,“They can put themselves back into the media plan from a cost savings point of view, so it is a right step forward for Mediacorp.,“That said, it is paramount that we, as agencies, place more rigour in analysing TV performance, since the tendency to buy more at a cheaper price may not necessarily yield effective deliverables.”,Somanathan: the tendency to buy more at a cheaper price may not necessarily yield effective deliverables,Addressing the creation of the new all-inclusive master contract, Singh said: “Gone are the days when advertisers used to plan for a medium and stick with it. You want advertisers to benefit from the full dynamism of what’s out there and not be stuck to a particular medium.”,This is also a way of encouraging advertisers to experiment with shifting ad dollars from media like TV to Mediacorp’s websites or OTT platform, options that may otherwise have been low on the priority list for marketers.,Mediacorp’s unique and structure — a state-owned broadcaster with multimedia interests — would no doubt have helped it put such a structure in place; a near impossibility in more fragmented media landscapes with a number of powerful private broadcasters vying for a share of the market.,Asked if there were any further expectations the agency and marketer ecosystem had from Mediacorp, Somanathan said: “Meeting agencies’ and clients’ expectations in areas like quality content creation, driving innovative partnerships and the openness to explore new avenues of advertising investment opportunities have placed Mediacorp in a strong place.,“There is always room for further improvement, though. However, I am confident that Mediacorp has the right mindset and resources to continuously evolve and improve the advertising opportunities it provides.”,Ravi is the editor at Mumbrella Asia. He has covered the marketing, advertising and media business for over two decades.,A bit late when nobody watches tv anymore. Rather redundant if you ask me.,How desperate are things in the new MediaCorp palace? Something in this story tells me revenue is falling drastically. Nothing in Mumbrella tells me what are the effects inside MediaCorp.,
