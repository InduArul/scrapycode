"Networking hardware colossus Cisco is helping businesses face disruption in technology to stay relevant, writes Balqis Lim, , businesses to remain relevant in this age of disruptive technology, they need to be able to imagine what the future looks like.,A disruptive technology is one that displaces an established technology and shakes up the industry, or a ground breaking product that creates a completely new industry.,We all hear about disruption today, and we can see how old norms and business models are being disrupted everyday mainly by technology.,Cisco Asia Pacific, China and Japan president Miyuki Suzuki said that underneath it all is discontinuity.,“Although unnerving, it also leads to other opportunities,” she said.,Suzuki cited the example of Airbnb, the world’s largest community-driven hospitality company offering homes and experiences. Airbnb, due to its unique business model, has created a disruption in the industry.,“Airbnb has changed the face of the hospitality industry and property rentals, thanks to a change in our values. We now allow strangers to ‘sleep in our beds’.,“But this discontinuity has created a disruption. There are now 2.2 million homes on the Airbnb website, with 90 million users in 34,000 cities. Melbourne alone has more than 17,000 listings,” said Suzuki during her opening keynote address at Cisco Live! Melbourne 2019 recently.,Cisco Live! is the industry’s annual premier conference for businesses, customers and partners to connect and engage with the best of Cisco’s technology, solutions, executives, engineers and IT experts.,Besides the innovation talks and comprehensive sessions, the World of Solutions exhibition showcases the latest technology from Cisco and its partners.,The event is designed to educate, inform and update external stakeholders including customers, partners, industry analysts and the media.,Talking to over 8,000 participants at the Crown Metropol hotel, Suzuki said it is all about the shared economy, optimising assets and on-demand experiences today.,“Companies, communities, and business models have to evolve to keep pace with these changes in our values.,“Look at the car industry. Their values are changing too. During my generation, the baby boomers, we cared about owning a luxury car as a status symbol. However, our children don’t want to own a car as they think it’s really wasteful for something to sit in the garage or parking lot 95 per cent of the time.”,However, discontinuity also creates an opportunity to move forward, and create something new, as well as change organisations.,Citing Kyoto in Japan, Suzuki said the city has transformed and embraced technology to modernise and change with the help of Cisco’s innovation.,With 80 million people visiting Kyoto every year, strategically-located smart kiosks connect tourists with a concierge who can steer them to less congested attractions. This will enable the crowd to be evenly distributed.,Among the examples of the modernisation effort in Kyoto is smart street lighting to monitor foot traffic. The system automatically controls the brightness of the lights when and where it is needed most. With the use of special terminals that monitor multiple cameras, data can be compared simultaneously, making the city safer and smarter., ,Echoing Suzuki, Cisco’s senior vice president and chief of operations Irving Tan said as artificial intelligence and machine learning are transforming experiences for customers, the world is seeing a disruptive power of digitisation in terms of business models.,He cited an example in China where WeChat, often viewed as a social media platform, is also one of the largest purely digital banks.,“It is completely digital, disrupting a well-established institution of financial payments. It supports one billion monthly users and processes more transactions than the entire amount of credit and debit cards in China.,“This shows how even traditional industries like the financial industry can be disrupted and transformed, and the scale and speed at which it is happening,” he said.,That disruption and speed are only going to get even faster with two changes that are happening on the horizon.,“The introduction of 5G networks and WiFi 6 will open unprecedented possibilities,” said Tan.,But as this happens, he explained, it also exposes organisations to more threats and data breaches. Organisations undergoing digitisation need to do it safely and securely.,A recent Cisco study across the Asia Pacific region involving 11 countries found that enterprises have to deal with 10,000 threats daily of which most organisations said they are only equipped to handle 50 per cent of those threats.,“It also requires us to have a different mindset towards security. Away from just pure prevention to rapid detection, which means security has to be applied everywhere and built into the entire digitisation framework.,“Being cybersafe is not a responsibility of just one department, but all employees have to be aware of the role they have to play in keeping an organisation safe,” said Tan., ,Organisations see the ability to leap ahead of the competition with digitisation.,In a recent Digital Ready Asia study by Cisco, it was revealed that 92 per cent of companies in the region have a digital transformation strategy and 88 per cent of them say that it is the right strategy to help them deliver their desired business goal.,Meanwhile, in terms of maturity, Cisco’s APAC SMB Digital Maturity Index shows Malaysia ranked 10th among 14 countries from the region, with Singapore, Japan and New Zealand taking the top three spots.,The Index also revealed that 61 per cent of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in Asia Pacific have started to embrace digitisation, which puts them in a good position to leverage opportunity.,The alarming bit is that 39 per cent of SMBs surveyed do not have digital efforts in place at all. These businesses are at the greatest risk. They will likely face a hard time keeping pace with their competitors in the industry. At worst, these companies may not exist in a few years.,Tan said Cisco is also helping organisations to realise and unlock the potential of their digital dream based on the foundation of secure, intelligent platform for digital business and taking advantage of multicloud, network reinvention, data, security, and the creation of meaningful customer experiences., ,Cisco is building a multi-domain architecture that delivers to any user and device through applications and data.,They include the Catalyst 9000, Google Cloud and AWS partnerships, crosswork automation for service providers, and Cisco Secure SD-WAN.,Cisco has also undergone its own digital transformation, leading with software-defined approach besides pivoting its business models.,Tan said Cisco’s digital architecture now includes cloud and infrastructure, applications, analytics and data.,The networking hardware colossus has also opened up a new ecosystem called DevNet, that is short for developer network.,This platform enables Cisco’s partners to develop solutions and capabilities specific to their industry needs. There are over 570,000 developers within the DevNet community today.,In helping its customers and partners to deliver innovation, Cisco has also rolled out 14 global Cisco Co-Innovation Centres, of which four are in the Asia Pacific and Japan region.,Through its Networking Academy, Cisco is also providing IT skills and career building programmes to institutions and individuals globally to help solve the problem of talent shortage and unlock opportunities of a digital economy.,“Digital transformation is paying off for us. I’m confident it can pay off for you too,” said Tan.,© , New Straits Times,,New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd.,A part of Media Prima Group.",,http://www2.nst.com.my/lifestyle/bots/2019/03/471928/transform-survive,,,Transform to survive | New Straits Times | Malaysia General Business Sports and Lifestyle News
